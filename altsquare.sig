S,RecogniseAltSquare,"G should be matrix group conjugate to the alternating square representation of SL( d, q ). Returns true/false, a map from SL( d, q ) to G, a map from G to SL( d, q ), and a matrix whose rows form a basis that exhibits the alt square structure. Supply CheckResult := true to check the final result. The basic algorithm is implemented in two variations. The first uses a recursive call for smaller dimensional alternating square recognition, while the second uses recognition of tensor decomposition with IsTensor. For SL(d,q) with d=5,6,8 the tensor decomposition version is used while for SL(d,q) with d=7 or d>8 the recursive version is called as default. This choice can be overwritten by setting UseTensorDecomposition to be true",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,178,,36,175,175,180,-38,-38
