Sp/SU with various dimensions "Classical forms must be irreducible" error message
        probable cause: not enough generator?

Omega-, 10, 3: does not  find suitable involution
        probable cause: dimension too small, the only possible decomposition would be 
        10=6+4, but dimension 6 is modular.


AltSquare( SU, 20, 5 ) IsTensor( aT ) fails
