Known issues with RecogniseSymSquare

RecogniseSymSquare( Sp, 6, 3 ) does not find suitable involution
        probable cause: dimension too small?

Sp/SU with various dimensions "Classical forms must be irreducible" error message
        probable cause: not enough generator?

RecogniseSymSquare( 1*, q, Omega+ ) does not detect when both components are Omega-
        probable cause: Omega- detection wrong
        PROBABLY SOLVED

RecogniseSymSquare( 12, 5, Omega+ ) various problem with SplitTensor
        probable cause: the smaller-dim spaces are symplectic and not orthogonal

Omega-, 10, 3: does not  find suitable involution

Omega-, 12, q : vK := Sqrt( 2*form[posK1,posK2] )^-1; gives zero

Omega( 9|11, q ): SplitTensor problem
        probable cause: trying to split tensor product in wrong order
                        or dimension too low?

Omega( 11, * ): not always finding involution
                probable cause: ???


Omega+, 12, 3: assert v; in line 471 of smalldimreps.m fails
