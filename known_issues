Sp( 12, 3) sym square: infinite loop in involution selection?

Omega+(d,q) sym square: sometimes fails at the end, no square root, or root not
        element of the field.

Omega-, 10, 3: does not  find suitable involution
        probable cause: dimension too small, the only possible decomposition would be 
        10=6+4, but dimension 6 is modular.

AltSquare Omega* does not work with recursion

AltSquare( SU, 20, 5 ) IsTensor( aT ) fails
AltSquare( SU, 20, 3 ) fails at v, al := IsIsomorphic( T, TT ); assert v;
